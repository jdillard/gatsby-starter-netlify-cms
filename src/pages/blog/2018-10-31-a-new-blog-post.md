As containers gain popularity for a broad variety of use cases, entrepreneurs and **infrastructure** software investors are focused on investing in the machinery around containers. But there is a particular notion that is emerging, which needs a name. **Today** Iâ€™m proposing that we start using the term container-native to refer to this notion.

I researched (googled) the term to learn how it was being used today. Turns out it is being **used** to refer to the idea of running containers on bare metal (rather than on VMs).
